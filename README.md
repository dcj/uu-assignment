# uu-assignment

This is simply a copy of the [uu-assignment project](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/recsys%2Fcode%2Fuu-assignment.zip) (a stubbed out framework) for the [Coursera Introduction to Recommender Systems MOOC](https://class.coursera.org/recsys-001/class/index)

## Running the project

Supposedly this template can be run thusly:

	mvn package
	sh ./target/bin/run-uu

However previous templates didn't run that way for me, and I had to copy the shell script, and play around with the paths/classpaths in order to make it run...
